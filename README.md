Cracking/Capture the Flag Repo Details:
=======================================

This repository is used for publicly storing solutions either created by myself or done collaboratively through the Capture the Flag team/club at Portland State University to Capture the Flag problems (CTF). Solutions done as part of the PSU CTF team will be properly accredited. 

Furthermore, it will be used to store cracking tools, methods and solutions found useful outside of online CTF 'curriculum'.
