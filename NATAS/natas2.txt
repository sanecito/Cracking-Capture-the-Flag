Looking at the page source we can see that:

<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<img src="files/pixel.png">
</div>
</body></html>

Which is clearly a lie in so far as there is something on the page. Clicking the source image gives us:
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/pixel.png

However, this is not useful. We can see however, there might be other files hosted and indeed, we can see a users.txt file containing what we need to access the next level:
# username:password
