Looking at the page source we can see:
<div id="content">
There is nothing on this page
<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->
</div>

Which having dealt with private tracker based torrent sites, this seemed to suggest a use of robots.txt. And indeed, there is a
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt

Looking at it we see:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t/

which means that the /s3cr3t/ part of the server is not viewable by robots, and since Google can't 'find it this time' due to this, we can dig deeper to
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/

which yields a users.txt
